                            The multiverse (or meta-universe) is the hypothetical set of finite and infinite possible universes,
                            including the universe we live in.
                            Together, these universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter,
                            energy, and the physical laws and constants that describe them.<br>

                            <strong>Storyverse</strong> is the hypothetical set of finite and infinite possible stories.<br>
                            All nodes represent possibilities from previous events of a story.
                            A story is a branch grouping nodes from the beginning.

                            A node is composed of several informations useful in different context.<br>
                            For example, all nodes have longitude and latitude because we want to place stories in space,
                            like in the <a href="{{pathFor 'home'}}" target="_blank">map</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also want to value stories with the cumulation of all their children upvotes.
                            It is concretely observable by the size of nodes in maps or networks.

                            Networks are here has our guidance system for moving node to node like we move in time.
